The document explores the vulnerabilities of cryptographic protocols (TLS, IPsec, and DNSSEC) to quantum threats. It uses STRIDE and PASTA threat modeling frameworks to identify risks, simulate attacks, and propose quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions.

Tech Stack Used:

Threat Modeling Frameworks: STRIDE, PASTA
Cryptographic Tools: NIST Post-Quantum Algorithms, RSA, ECC
Simulation Tools: Metasploit, Wireshark, Scapy
Environment: Virtualized networks, Docker, custom quantum-safe cryptographic librariesâ€‹
